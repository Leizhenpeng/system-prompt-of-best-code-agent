# System Prompt Repository

This repository contains various system prompts used by different AI-powered tools and applications. System prompts define how AI assistants behave and interact with users when performing tasks.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains system prompts for different purposes and applications:

- **agent.md**: Defines the behavior of an AI agent that autonomously solves tasks and can use various tools to read files, search through code, make edits, run terminal commands, and more.

- **ask.md**: Contains the system prompt for question-answering mode, focusing on responding to user queries without necessarily making edits.

- **mannus.md**: Provides a more basic system prompt with limited tool access, mainly focused on communication and making suggestions without direct file manipulation.

## Purpose

These system prompts are the foundation of how AI assistants understand their roles and capabilities when helping users. They define:

- How the AI should communicate with users
- What tools the AI can access and how to use them
- How to search and read files in a codebase
- Guidelines for making changes
- Rules for summarizing conversations

The system prompts help create a consistent, helpful, and effective AI assistant experience.

## Version

This repository is actively maintained and updated with new system prompts and improvements.
